# ten-to-fifteen-times
21:02 PM LƒÅpule 12/xii/2021 This is a repository I'm creating on resources that I plan to read, watch, listen, or consume entirely for around ten to fifteen times. I got this idea from life coach Corey Wayne who tells his viewers to read his book "3%" man 10-15 times in order to fully understand the material in that book. I got the idea of making this repository from watching Dave Chappelle's Block Party that's showing on Netflix all the way to December 31st. I realized that even though I watched this entire movie already maybe a year ago and have watched clips on Youtube from the documentary over and over again, I still am learning more stuff from that documentary on the second time around. So, I wanted to watch the film and take notes of the valuable things I've learned and continue doing this for more resources to come.
